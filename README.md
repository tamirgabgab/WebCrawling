# WebCrawling
A web crawler is an internet bot, also known as a web spider, automatic indexer, or web robot, which works to systematically crawl the web. These bots are almost like the archivists and librarians of the internet. <br>
  To find the most reliable and relevant information, a bot will start with a certain selection of web pages. It will search (or crawl) these for data, then follow the links mentioned in them (or spider) to other pages, where it will do the same thing all over again.
